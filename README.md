## Hardware

Circuit diagrams are drawn with this [Circuit Simulator](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/).<br/>
Diagrams are saved as `txt` files, you can import them under `File > Import From Text`.

Embedded System: Raspberry Pi 3.

The release button should be connected between a GPIO pin and ground.<br/>
The GPIO pin should be configured as an input **with internal pull-up**.
